## Introduction: Big Data

* With increase in data size a new technology handling huge data efficiently is required, different from current servers storing data in limited space with okay speed.
* Big Data is the data that is too large & difficult to process by DBMS tools. All data analytics challenges are inherited to it also.
* __Big Data Characteristics:__
```
Huge Volume
Velocity
Variety
Veracity: Ambiguity & Uncertainity, one of the most important components
Value, some quantified output must be there.
```
* __Types of Big Data__
```
Structured: RDBMS & SQL, PL/SQL is often used for this kind of data.
Semi-Structured: XML, JSON etc. can be used to structure it.
Unstructured: Unknown form of data.
```
* __Challenges Of Big Data__
```
Data Quality
Discovery
Storage
Analytics
Security
```
* __Hadoop: __ Apache's Java-based programming framework, storage & processing large datasets in distributed computing environment.
```
Problems: Even more processing units won't help as memory resource will get bottleneck.
         Even with parallel seperate units(for processing/memory) problem of overloading might happen.
