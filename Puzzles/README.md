In this section top 10 Martin Gardner Physics Stumper are asked & Solved in the end in reference to following [link](http://www.martin-gardner.org/Top10MGPhysics.html).  
This page contains only questions. These problems can be tried all at once in start time. This Section contain solution approaches to it.

### Solutions

* Reflection in the mirror flip horizontally because we flip it horizontally & than analyze the situation.
  Like when reading a word, we are looking onto it. But, when reading from mirror we are from reflection of image which is flipped.
  Mirror flips in __z direction, i.e. forward becomes backword.__

* Metal with expand in all direction in volume basis, hole size will decrease. (Delta)V/V = (Gamma)*(Delta)T.

* Colliding missile problem, convert speed into minutes per hour after adding their speeds. As, two missiles approaching each other can equally be treated like going away from one another.

* Magnet Testing Problem: Take, let say bar A & put it in b/w center of bar B. Magnetic Force is minimum at center & maximum at poles. If, bar get's lifted than bar A is magnet, strongest force or vice-versa scenario.

* Water level stays same. As, ice-cube is expanded with crystalization process, after melting the volume of cube remains the same.

* Water level goes down. As boat rises with falling cargo the volume displacement of water by this boat goes down & it water level goes down. Shape of boat places a vital role in displacement of water.

* No, not in a air tight container. As, these birds would push down the container with same Gravitational Force as before while flying.

* Helium is lighter than atmospheric air. Hence, it will move forward when breaks applied & will move in the direction of curve i.e. in inwards direction.

* Hollow Moon: For bodies near the edge of shell, will gets pulled towards the shell. Take small mass _dm_ & calculated force exerted by it on the object, after that integrate it for all mass components. This will lead to a resultant force directing towards the shell's mass instead of center.

* Simple center of mass problem. Let the can be filled upto an height 'y' < h/2 & create a function equation from center of mass equation, than calculate derivative to evaluate the result.
