In this section top 10 Martin Gardner Physics Stumper are asked & Solved in the end in reference to following [link](http://www.martin-gardner.org/Top10MGPhysics.html).  
This page contains only questions. These problems can be tried all at once in start time. This Section contain solution approaches to it.


* Reflection in the mirror flip horizontally because we flip it horizontally & than analyze the situation.
  Like when reading a word, we are looking onto it. But, when reading from mirror we are from reflection of image which is flipped.
  Mirror flips in __z direction, i.e. forward becomes backword.__

* Metal with expand in all direction in volume basis, hole size will decrease. (Delta)V/V = (Gamma)*(Delta)T.

* Magnet Testing Problem: Pending.

* Water level stays same. As, ice-cube is expanded with crystalization process, after melting the volume of cube remains the same.
